## Description

My client's wants on how the site should look/work were clear:

	1. She wanted it to be open and simple.
	2. She wanted the site to focus on starting a conversation with perspective clients.
	3. She wanted the site to continue to be useful to her current clients by utilizing a calendar API.

Her biggest need:
	1. She would like the site to be open and simple so that she can make updates/changes herself later.  She was not familiar with JS frameworks, but could adjust simple code.

	The site is still under construction as the client selects API's for calendar/payment.
